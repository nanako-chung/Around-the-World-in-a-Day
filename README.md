# Around-the-World-in-a-Day
One of my New Year's Resolutions for 2018 is to memorize all of the countries in the world. Growing up in NYC all my life, I have realized just how ignorant I am about the rest of the world. Additionally, one of my greatest fears is meeting someone from a place that I have never heard of. At this point, I have most of the countries memorized (about 130). 

With this project, I plan to combine my passions for learning geography and coding. I will list all of the countries I know by memory and, according to continent, organize them using different data structures. Then, I will provide one fun fact for each country. Enjoy!
